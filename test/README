This application links against a static library called libTestUtils.
The project includes both the device and simulator versions of this library.
If you'd like to run this app on a device (performance profiling) you'll need to link against the device version.

Tasks:

Fix memory leaks using Instruments.

Support landscape orientation.

Add "previousValue" attribute to the CategoryMember property.

Display the title of the category in the navigation bar.

Implement the -refresh method in CategoryMemberViewController.
You'll need to do this before any data is displayed.
This action is invoked when the user taps the refresh button.

The table view cells should display the difference between the new value and the previous value.
For example, "+1,100" or "-1,200"

Add an arrow accessory (Arrow.png) to the table view cells to indicate whether the CategoryMember's value is greater or less than its previous value.
If greater, arrow should be pointed up.
If less, arrow should be pointed down.

Using instruments, identify and list the most significant performance issues.
Resolve performance issues.

Create a new arrow accessory.
Subclass UIView.
Your class should have a "color" property that allows the color of the arrow to be changed.
Using CoreGraphics, draw the triangle with the color specified by the color property.
Update CategoryMemberViewController to display red arrows when the values are down and green arrows when the values are up.

Add a toolbar.
Add a segmented control to the toolbar.
The segmented control should have three buttons. An up arrow, down arrow, and "ALL" button. (up.png and down.png)
When the up arrow is tapped, only display items whose value is greater than their previous value.
When the down arrow is tapped, only display items whose value is less than the previous value.
When the ALL button is tapped, display all items.

Feel free to add any of your own improvements.
